Check the coding style of C files to follow ACU's coding style.

This script is supposed to analyse:
- a *.c* or *.h* file
- a list of *.c* or *.h* files
- a directory that contains *.c* or *.h*

It is based on the Coding Style document provided by the ACUs at the beginning of the year. Since this document is distributed with strict diffusion rules, we are not allowed the share it or its content online.
However, if you are an EPITA student, you have access to this document on the ACU's intranet.
